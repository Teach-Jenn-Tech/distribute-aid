# Distribute Aid

✨Hello beaufitul human!✨

Distribute Aid powers the world's largest mutual aid supply-chain. Last year we
organized 75+ aid shipments that helped hundreds of grassroots organizations
deliver more than $15,000,000 worth of aid. Our current responses include:

  - USA - Refugee Support
  - USA - Mutual Aid Support
  - Europe - Refugee Support
  - Europe -  Aid to Ukraine
  - Lebanon - Refugee Support
  - Lebanon - Economic Development

The goal of our OSS Thursdays stream is to raise awareness about the open-srouce
work that we do, and how contributors can get involved. We cover the perspectives
of both maintainers and contributors, with most streams including a live coding
segment. We also use the streams as an opportunity to engage with our open-source
community, inviting audience participation and guest appearances on the stream.
