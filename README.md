# OSS Thursdays with Distribute Aid and Teach Jenn Tech

### ✨Hello beaufitul human!✨

**Distribute Aid** powers the world's largest mutual aid supply-chain. Last year we
organized 75+ aid shipments that helped hundreds of grassroots organizations
deliver more than $15,000,000 worth of aid. Our current responses include:

  - **USA** - Refugee Support
  - **USA** - Mutual Aid Support
  - **Europe** - Refugee Support
  - **Europe** -  Aid to Ukraine
  - **Lebanon** - Refugee Support
  - **Lebanon** - Economic Development

The goal of our **OSS Thursdays** stream is to raise awareness about the open-srouce
work that we do, and how contributors can get involved. We cover the perspectives
of both maintainers and contributors, with most streams including a live coding
segment. We also use the streams as an opportunity to engage with our open-source
community, inviting audience participation and guest appearances on the stream.
